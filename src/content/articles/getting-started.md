# Getting Started with GalleryPlanner

Creating your first gallery wall can feel overwhelming—where do you even start? This quick-start guide will walk you through designing your first layout in GalleryPlanner in just 5 minutes. No experience required.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin:

- **Wall measurements:** Width and height of the area where you want your gallery wall
- **Frame inventory:** Dimensions of the frames you own (or plan to buy)
- **5 minutes:** That's it!

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Wall (30 seconds)

When you first open [GalleryPlanner](/), you'll see the Wall Configuration panel.

1. Enter your wall **width** (e.g., 96 inches for an 8-foot wall)
2. Enter your wall **height** (e.g., 72 inches for 6 feet)
3. Click **"Apply"**

**Pro tip:** Measure the actual area where you want frames, not your entire wall. If you're planning a gallery wall above a sofa, measure from the top of the sofa to the ceiling.

**Not sure about dimensions?** Start with a standard 96" × 72" wall to experiment—you can always adjust later.

## Step 2: Add Frames to Your Library (1 minute)

Now it's time to add the frames you own (or want to buy).

### Using Standard Sizes

Most frames come in standard sizes. Here's how to add them:

1. Open the **Library** panel (left sidebar on desktop, bottom toolbar on mobile)
2. Browse the standard sizes: 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 11x14, 16x20, etc.
3. Click the **"+"** button next to each size you have
4. Adjust the **count** if you have multiples (e.g., "I have 5 8x10 frames")

### Creating Custom Frames

Have an unusual frame size?

1. Click **"Custom Frame"** in the Library
2. Enter the exact width and height (measure the outer edges of the frame)
3. Choose a frame color (black, white, wood, gold, or custom)
4. Click **"Add to Library"**

**Example:** Let's say you have:
- 3 black 8×10 frames
- 2 black 5×7 frames  
- 1 large 16×20 frame

Add each of these to your library by clicking the "+" button and adjusting counts.

## Step 3: Design Your Layout (2 minutes)

Now for the fun part—arranging your frames!

### Option A: Let AI Do It (Easiest)

1. Click **"Smart Layout"** in the toolbar
2. Select **"Auto"** (recommended) or choose a specific style:
   - **Grid:** Clean, organized rows and columns
   - **Masonry:** Staggered, brick-like pattern
   - **Skyline:** Frames align at top or bottom
3. Click **"Generate"**

In seconds, GalleryPlanner will create a professional layout using your frame inventory. Don't love it? Click "Generate" again for a new arrangement.



### Option B: Design Manually (More Control)

Prefer a hands-on approach?

1. **Drag frames** from your library onto the canvas
2. **Position them** where you want using click-and-drag
3. Use **alignment guides** (they appear automatically) to keep frames evenly spaced
4. **Rotate frames** by clicking the rotation icon

**Pro tip:** Start with your largest frame first—place it where you want the focal point, then build around it.

---

## Step 4: Customize Your Design (1 minute)

Once your frames are on the wall, fine-tune the details.

### Adjust Frame Properties

Click any frame on your canvas to open the **Properties Panel**:

- **Position:** See exact X/Y coordinates
- **Size:** Width and height (custom frames can be resized)
- **Rotation:** Rotate to landscape or portrait
- **Frame Color:** Change the color even after placement
- **Matting:** Toggle matting on/off

### Add Photos (Optional)

Want to see what your gallery wall will look like with actual photos?

1. Select a frame on the canvas
2. Click **"Add Photo"** in the Properties panel
3. Choose a photo from your device
4. The photo fills the frame automatically

**Privacy note:** Your photos stay on your device—they're never uploaded to a server. [Learn more](/privacy).

## Step 5: Export Your Design (1 minute)

You've created your layout—now let's export it so you can hang it in real life!

### Option 1: Download PDF Hanging Guide (Pro)

The PDF gives you exact measurements for every nail:

1. Click **"Export"** in the toolbar
2. Select **"Download PDF Hanging Guide"**
3. Print it and use it as your installation blueprint

**What you get:**
- Full layout diagram with measurements
- Coordinates for each nail (measured from wall edges)
- Step-by-step hanging instructions

### Option 2: Save as Image

1. Click **"Export"** → **"Download as Image"**
2. Choose your resolution
3. Use the image as a visual reference while hanging

### Option 3: Save Your Project

Come back later to make changes:

1. Click **"Project"** → **"Save Project"**
2. Download the `.gallery` file
3. Reload it anytime by clicking **"Load Project"**

**Auto-save:** GalleryPlanner automatically saves your work in your browser, so you can close the app and return later without losing progress.

## Quick Tips for Beginners

### ✅ Start Simple

Your first project doesn't need to be complicated. Try a basic 3-frame horizontal row or a simple 2×2 grid to get comfortable with the tools.

### ✅ Use Smart Layout as a Starting Point

Even if you want full creative control, generate a Smart Layout first to see what's possible. Then adjust it manually.

### ✅ Experiment Freely

You can't break anything! Try different layouts, colors, and arrangements. If you mess up, just click "Clear Wall" and start over.

### ✅ Measure Your Frames Accurately

The most common mistake? Measuring the mat or photo inside the frame instead of the outer frame edges. Always measure the full frame dimensions.

### ✅ Check Your Design on Mobile

Planning to shop for frames later? Save your project and open it on your phone. Pull it up at the store to see if frames will fit your layout.

## Troubleshooting: First-Timer FAQs

**"I don't see my frames on the canvas after adding them to the library."**

→ You need to *drag* frames from the library onto the canvas. Adding them to the library just makes them available—placement is a separate step.

**"Smart Layout says 'Not enough frames.'"**

→ You need at least 3-4 frames in your library for Smart Layout to work. Add more frames to your inventory.

**"I can't move my frame exactly where I want it."**

→ Frames snap to a grid by default for alignment. Hold `Shift` while dragging for free movement, or disable snap-to-grid in Settings.

**"Where did my project go?"**

→ Check that you're using the same browser. Projects are saved locally per browser. For cross-device access, export your project as a `.gallery` file.
