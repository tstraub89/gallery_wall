# Understanding Smart Layout: AI-Powered Gallery Wall Design

Staring at a pile of frames wondering how they'll fit together? GalleryPlanner's **Smart Layout** feature uses AI algorithms to generate professional-quality gallery wall arrangements in seconds. This guide explains how it works, when to use it, and how to get the best results.

## What is Smart Layout?

Smart Layout is an AI-powered tool that automatically arranges your frame inventory into aesthetically pleasing, balanced layouts. Instead of manually dragging and dropping frames for hours, Smart Layout does the heavy lifting—generating dozens of layout options based on proven design principles.

**Think of it as:** Having a professional interior designer instantly create custom layouts tailored to your exact frame collection.

## How Smart Layout Works

Under the hood, Smart Layout uses **advanced computational algorithms** to solve the gallery wall layout problem. Here's what happens when you click "Generate":

### 1. **Input Analysis**

The algorithm reads your frame inventory:
- Frame dimensions (width × height)
- Quantity of each frame size
- Wall dimensions and constraints

### 2. **Algorithm Selection**

You can choose from 5 specialized algorithms (or let "Auto" pick the best one):

- **Grid Generator:** Organizes frames into perfect rows and columns
- **Masonry Generator:** Creates a brick-like, staggered pattern
- **Skyline Generator:** Aligns frames along top or bottom edges
- **Monte Carlo Generator:** Uses randomized placement with visual optimization
- **Spiral Generator:** Arranges frames radiating outward from a center point

### 3. **Layout Generation**

The algorithm places frames on your wall while respecting:

- **Spacing rules:** 2-3 inches between all frames (industry standard)
- **Visual balance:** Distributing visual weight evenly across the composition
- **Collision detection:** Ensuring frames don't overlap
- **Wall boundaries:** Keeping all frames within your wall dimensions

### 4. **Optimization**

The algorithm evaluates the layout based on:

- **Symmetry vs. asymmetry** (depending on the algorithm)
- **Negative space distribution** (avoiding crowding)
- **Focal point prominence** (highlighting the largest or most important frame)

### 5. **Result**

You get a production-ready layout in seconds. Don't love it? Click "Generate" again for a completely new arrangement—each run produces different results (except Grid, which is deterministic).

## The 5 Layout Algorithms Explained

Each algorithm creates a distinct aesthetic. Here's a quick comparison:

| Algorithm | Creates | Best For | Aesthetic |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 🟦 **Grid** | Rows and columns | Uniform frames, modern spaces | Clean, minimalist |
| 🧱 **Masonry** | Staggered, brick-like pattern | Mixed sizes, eclectic walls | Organic, balanced |
| 🏙️ **Skyline** | Horizontal edge alignment | Above furniture, narrow walls | Linear, architectural |
| 🎲 **Monte Carlo** | Randomized, organic layouts | Large collections, salon walls | Curated, collected |
| 🌀 **Spiral** | Radiating from center | Statement walls, focal points | Dramatic, artistic |

### 🟦 Grid Generator

**What it creates:** Clean rows and columns with perfect alignment.

**Best for:**
- Modern, minimalist spaces
- Uniform frame sizes (e.g., all 8×10)
- Creating a sense of order and calm
- Photo walls with family portraits or travel pics

**Design principle:** Symmetry, structure, repetition.

**Example:** A 3×3 grid of black-framed family photos in a hallway.

**Pro tip:** Works best when you have multiples of the same frame size. Mixed sizes can create awkward gaps in grid layouts.

---

### 🧱 Masonry Generator

**What it creates:** A staggered, brick-like pattern with organic flow.

**Best for:**
- Mixing different frame sizes
- Creating visual interest without strict symmetry
- Contemporary or eclectic interiors
- Salon-style walls with diverse content

**Design principle:** Asymmetry, rhythm, visual weight distribution.

**Example:** A living room wall with a mix of 5×7, 8×10, and 11×14 frames in various orientations.

**Pro tip:** Masonry layouts work well with odd numbers of frames (5, 7, 9) for more dynamic compositions.

---

### 🏙️ Skyline Generator

**What it creates:** Frames aligned along a horizontal edge (top or bottom), creating a "skyline" effect.

**Best for:**
- Linear, horizontal spaces (above a sofa, along a hallway)
- Emphasizing width rather than height
- Modern, architectural aesthetics
- Mixing tall and short frames

**Design principle:** Baseline alignment, horizontal rhythm.

**Example:** Frames of varying heights aligned at the bottom edge above a console table.

**Pro tip:** Skyline layouts draw the eye horizontally, making them perfect for narrow walls or low ceilings.

---

### 🎲 Monte Carlo Generator

**What it creates:** Randomized, organic arrangements that feel curated rather than planned.

**Best for:**
- Maximum flexibility with frame sizes and orientations
- Creating a "collected over time" salon wall aesthetic
- When you want unexpected, creative layouts
- Large walls with lots of frames

**Design principle:** Controlled chaos, visual balance through randomization.

**Example:** An eclectic mix of 10+ frames in various sizes, colors, and orientations that somehow "just works."

**Pro tip:** Monte Carlo can produce wildly different results each time—run it multiple times until you find a layout you love. This algorithm is great for when you don't know what you want but you'll know it when you see it.

---

### 🌀 Spiral Generator

**What it creates:** Frames arranged in a spiral pattern radiating outward from a central focal point.

**Best for:**
- Creating a dramatic, eye-catching statement wall
- Emphasizing a central piece (largest frame in the middle)
- Unique, artistic arrangements
- Rooms where the gallery wall is the main feature

**Design principle:** Radial symmetry, centrifugal flow.

**Example:** A large 16×20 frame in the center surrounded by progressively smaller frames spiraling outward.

**Pro tip:** Spiral layouts work best with a clear size hierarchy (one large central piece, medium frames, then small accents).

## When to Use Smart Layout

### ✅ Use Smart Layout When:

- You have **no idea where to start** and need inspiration
- You're working with **many frames** (5+) and manual placement feels overwhelming
- You want to **explore different styles** quickly
- You're **short on time** and need a good-enough layout fast
- You want a **professional baseline** to customize further

### ❌ Skip Smart Layout When:

- You have a **very specific vision** in mind that's easy to execute manually
- You're working with **very few frames** (2-3) where manual placement is faster
- Your frames have **unconventional shapes or requirements** that algorithms can't handle
- You want **complete creative control** from start to finish

## Getting the Best Results from Smart Layout

### Tip 1: Build a Diverse Frame Library

Smart Layout works best with variety:

- **Mix sizes:** Include small (4×6, 5×7), medium (8×10, 11×14), and large (16×20, 18×24) frames
- **Mix orientations:** Have both portrait and landscape options
- **Mix quantities:** Having multiples of some sizes (e.g., three 8×10 frames) gives the algorithm more flexibility

**Example inventory for great results:**
- 1× 16×20 (focal point)
- 2× 11×14 (supporting pieces)
- 3× 8×10 (filler frames)
- 4× 5×7 (accents)

---

### Tip 2: Try Multiple Algorithms

Each algorithm produces a different aesthetic. Don't settle for the first result:

1. Click "Smart Layout"
2. Try **Auto** first to see what the system recommends
3. Then manually try **Grid**, **Masonry**, **Skyline**, etc.
4. Compare results and pick your favorite

---

### Tip 3: Run It Multiple Times

Most algorithms (except Grid) have randomness built in. Run the same algorithm 3-5 times to see different variations.

1. Click "Generate"
2. Don't love it? Click "Generate" again immediately
3. Each run produces a fresh layout with different frame positions

---

### Tip 4: Use Smart Layout as a Starting Point

You don't have to accept the layout exactly as generated:

1. Generate a Smart Layout
2. **Manually adjust** frames that feel slightly off
3. **Swap frames** for different sizes if needed
4. **Fine-tune spacing** for your personal preference

Think of Smart Layout as a professional designer's first draft—you're the creative director making final edits.

---

### Tip 5: Adjust Wall Size if Layouts Feel Cramped

If Smart Layout keeps producing crowded arrangements:

- Your wall might be too small for your frame inventory
- Try reducing the number of frames in your library
- Or increase your wall dimensions to give frames more breathing room

**Rule of thumb:** Your frames should cover about 60-70% of your wall area. If Smart Layout uses 90%+, you likely have too many frames for that wall size.

## Smart Layout vs. Manual Placement: When to Use Each

| Scenario | Best Approach |
|----------|---------------|
| First-time user, no design experience | **Smart Layout** (Auto mode) |
| Experienced designer with clear vision | **Manual placement** |
| 10+ frames, complex mix of sizes | **Smart Layout** (try all algorithms) |
| 2-3 frames, simple arrangement | **Manual placement** |
| Exploring different styles quickly | **Smart Layout** (run multiple algorithms) |
| Recreating a specific Pinterest inspiration | **Manual placement** |
| Need a layout in under 1 minute | **Smart Layout** |
| Want complete creative control | **Manual placement** |
| Mixing both? | **Smart Layout first, then manual tweaks** |

## Behind the Scenes: The Technical Details

For the data nerds and algorithm enthusiasts:

### Monte Carlo Generator

Based on the **Monte Carlo method**, this algorithm uses random sampling and statistical optimization:

1. Randomly places frames on the wall
2. Evaluates the layout quality using a scoring function (considers balance, spacing, overlap)
3. Runs thousands of iterations, keeping the best-scoring layout
4. Uses simulated annealing to escape local optima

**Why it's powerful:** Can find creative solutions that deterministic algorithms miss.

---

### Skyline Generator

Inspired by the **skyline packing problem** from computer science:

1. Maintains a "skyline" (horizontal edge) as frames are placed
2. Places frames left-to-right, always aligning to the skyline
3. Updates the skyline as each frame is added
4. Optimizes for minimal height variance

**Why it's powerful:** Guarantees clean horizontal alignment while maximizing space efficiency.

---

### Grid Generator

Uses a **bin-packing algorithm** to fit frames into grid cells:

1. Calculates optimal grid cell size based on frame dimensions
2. Assigns frames to cells, minimizing empty space
3. Centers the entire grid on the wall
4. Ensures uniform spacing between all frames

**Why it's powerful:** Produces clean, predictable results perfect for symmetry-lovers.

## Troubleshooting Smart Layout

### "Smart Layout says 'Not enough frames.'"

**Solution:** Add at least 4 frames to your library. The algorithms need sufficient inventory to generate meaningful layouts.

---

### "All my frames overlap."

**Solution:** Your frames are too large for your wall. Either:
- Reduce the number of frames in your library
- Increase your wall dimensions
- Remove a few of the largest frames

---

### "The layout looks too crowded."

**Solution:** 
- Manually remove 1-2 frames after generation
- Try a different algorithm (Skyline or Grid tend to be less dense than Masonry or Monte Carlo)
- Increase wall size

---

### "I keep getting the exact same layout."

**Solution:** You're likely using the **Grid** algorithm, which is deterministic (always produces the same result for the same inputs). Try **Monte Carlo** or **Masonry** for variation.
