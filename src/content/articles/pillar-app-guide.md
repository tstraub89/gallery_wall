## Building Your Frame Library

The **Frame Library** is where you manage your frame inventory—the collection of frames you own or plan to buy.

### Adding Standard Frames

GalleryPlanner includes presets for common frame sizes:

### Creating Custom Frames

Got an unusual frame size or unique piece?

1. Click **"Custom Frame"** in the Library panel
2. Enter exact **width** and **height** dimensions
3. Choose frame color (black, white, natural wood, gold, or custom color)
4. Decide if the frame has matting
5. Click **"Add to Library"**

### Frame Customization Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Frame Color** | Black, white, natural wood, metallic gold, or any custom color |

## Designing Your Layout

### Manual Placement

**Drag and drop** frames from your library onto the wall canvas:

1. Hover over a frame in your library
2. **Click and drag** it onto your wall
3. Release to place
4. Frames will snap to alignment guides and other frames for precision

### Moving and Adjusting Frames

Once a frame is on your wall:

- **Move:** Click and drag to reposition
- **Rotate:** Click the rotate icon or use the rotation handle
- **Delete:** Click the trash icon to remove and return it to your library
- **Resize:** Some frames allow resizing directly on the canvas (custom frames only)

### Alignment Tools

GalleryPlanner includes smart alignment features:

- **Snap to Grid:** Frames align to an invisible grid for clean spacing
- **Alignment Lines:** Visual guides appear when frames align horizontally or vertically
- **Distribution Tools:** Evenly space multiple frames with one click
- **Center Alignment:** Quickly center your entire layout on the wall

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

## Smart Layout: AI-Powered Design (Pro Feature)

Can't decide where to put your frames? Let the AI do the heavy lifting.

### How Smart Layout Works

Smart Layout uses advanced algorithms to generate professional-quality layouts based on your frame inventory. It considers:

- Frame sizes and proportions
- Visual balance and weight distribution
- Industry-standard spacing rules (2-3 inches between frames)
- Aesthetic principles (focal points, rhythm, symmetry)

### Using Smart Layout

1. Make sure you have frames in your library
2. Click **"Smart Layout"** in the toolbar
3. Choose an algorithm:
   - **Auto (Recommended):** Tries multiple algorithms and picks the best result
   - **Grid:** Organized rows and columns
   - **Masonry:** Brick-like staggered pattern
   - **Skyline:** Frames align at top or bottom edges
   - **Monte Carlo:** Randomized, organic arrangements
   - **Spiral:** Radiates outward from a central point
4. Click **"Generate Layout"**
5. Review the result—if you don't love it, click **"Generate"** again for a new arrangement

**Pro tip:** Use Smart Layout as a starting point, then manually adjust frames to personalize the design.

## Tips for Power Users

### Tip 1: Use Templates

Start with a proven layout and customize it:
1. Click **"Templates"** in the toolbar (Pro feature)
2. Browse curated layouts (grid, salon, symmetrical, etc.)
3. Select a template to load it onto your canvas
4. Adjust frames to match your specific inventory

### Tip 2: Measure Twice, Design Once

Before opening GalleryPlanner:
- Measure your wall accurately (width, height, and note any obstacles)
- Measure every frame you own (outer dimensions, including the frame itself)
- Take photos of your frames to remember colors and styles

### Tip 3: Start with the Largest Frame

Professional designers typically:
1. Place the largest or most important frame first (the focal point)
2. Build the layout around that anchor piece
3. Use smaller frames to fill gaps and create balance

### Tip 4: Leave Breathing Room

Don't fill every inch! Negative space (empty wall) is important:
- Aim for 20-30% of your wall to remain empty
- Maintain 2-3 inches between all frames
- Leave extra space around the edges of your layout

### Tip 5: Test on Mobile, Finalize on Desktop

- Use mobile to brainstorm ideas on the couch or while shopping for frames
- Switch to desktop for precise adjustments and exporting
- Your projects sync via browser storage (or export/import `.gallery` files)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "My frames won't snap into place"

**Solution:** Disable "Free Move" mode in Settings. Snap-to-grid is enabled by default, but you may have turned it off accidentally.

---

### "I can't find my saved project"

**Solution:** 
- Check that you're using the same browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) where you created the project
- Browser data isn't shared across devices unless you manually export/import the `.gallery` file
- If you cleared browser cache, local projects may be lost—always export important projects!

---

### "Smart Layout isn't working"

**Solution:**
- Ensure you have at least 3-4 frames in your library
- Check that your wall dimensions are large enough to fit your frames
- Pro features require an active Pro account (free during beta)

---

### "My photos look blurry in the design"

**Solution:** 
- Upload higher-resolution photos (at least 1000px on the longest side)
- When zoomed in, low-res photos will pixelate—this is normal
- Exported PDFs and images use the best quality available from your source photos
