## Adhesive Strips: Your Most Versatile Option

Adhesive strips like Command Strips are the workhorses of renter-friendly hanging. When used correctly, they hold surprisingly well and remove cleanly.

### Brand Comparison

| Brand | Small | Medium | Large |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Command | 4 lbs | 8 lbs | 16 lbs |
| Gorilla | 5 lbs | 10 lbs | 20 lbs |
| Generic | 3 lbs | 6 lbs | 10 lbs |

### Where They Work

| Surface | Works? |
|---------|--------|
| Smooth painted drywall | ✅ Yes |
| Semi-gloss paint | ✅ Yes |
| Textured walls | ❌ No |
| Wallpaper | ❌ No |
| Bathroom (humid) | ❌ No |

### Proper Application

Most adhesive strip failures come from improper application:

1. **Clean the wall** with isopropyl alcohol
2. **Wait 10 minutes** for complete drying
3. **Apply strips to frame first**, not the wall
4. **Press firmly 30 seconds** in each spot
5. **Wait 1 hour** before hanging—overnight is better

Skip any step and you risk a crashed frame at 2 AM.

## Picture Ledges: The Leaning Approach

Picture ledges eliminate hanging entirely. You lean frames on a narrow shelf, making it easy to swap, rearrange, or add pieces. Install one ledge with just 2-4 screws (easy to patch when you move).

### Popular Options

| Product | Length | Price |
|---------|--------|-------|
| IKEA Mosslanda | 45" | $ |
| IKEA Ribba | 21"/45" | $ |
| Floating shelf | Varies | $$ |

### Styling Tips

The key to great ledge displays is **layering**. Overlap frames front-to-back to create depth—larger pieces in back, smaller ones in front. Mix in non-frame items like plants or decorative objects. Use odd numbers (3, 5, or 7) for a more dynamic feel.

## Picture Rails: The Professional Solution

A track mounts near the ceiling, and frames hang from adjustable cables. Once installed (2-4 screws per section), you can rearrange without ever touching the wall again.

| System | Flexibility | Price |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| STAS | Unlimited | $$$ |
| Gallery System | Professional | $$ |
| IKEA HAGHED | Basic | $ |

Many landlords actually appreciate picture rails because they reduce cumulative wall damage.

## The Leaning Gallery

The simplest approach requires no installation at all. Large frames (24×36+) look fantastic leaned against a wall on a mantel, console table, or even the floor.

| Location | Frame Sizes |
|----------|-------------|
| Mantel | Small to medium |
| Console table | Medium to large |
| Floor | Large (24×36+) |

Use museum putty to prevent sliding, and angle frames slightly back so gravity works with you.

## Lightweight Frame Materials

If your heart is set on adhesive strips, lighter frames expand your options:

| Material | Weight Savings |
|----------|----------------|
| Acrylic instead of glass | 60% lighter |
| Polystyrene frames | 70% lighter |
| Frameless clips | 80% lighter |
| Canvas prints | 90% lighter |

An 11×14 with glass weighs 4-6 lbs. With acrylic: 2-3 lbs. That difference determines how many strips you need.

## Weight Reference

| Frame Size | With Glass | With Acrylic |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 4×6" | 0.5-1 lb | ~0.3 lb |
| 8×10" | 2-4 lbs | 1-2 lbs |
| 11×14" | 4-6 lbs | 2-3 lbs |
| 16×20" | 8-12 lbs | 4-6 lbs |

**The rule:** If your frame exceeds 16 lbs, use a ledge, rail, or furniture—adhesive won't cut it.
