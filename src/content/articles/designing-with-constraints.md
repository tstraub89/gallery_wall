# Beyond the Frame: Designing Around Sconces, Switches, and Vents

When we envision a gallery wall, we usually imagine a pristine, empty rectangle of drywall. In reality, our walls are filled with "immovable objects": light switches, thermostats, wall sconces, heating vents, and even intercom systems.

These aren't obstacles to be ignored; they are **constraints** that should be built into your design from day one. In this guide, we'll show you how to use GalleryPlanner to design a layout that feels integrated with your room's architecture.

## 1. Mapping Your "Dead Zones"

Before you place a single virtual frame, you need to map out the "no-go" areas on your wall.

- **Measure the Center-Point:** For things like light switches or sconces, measure their height from the floor and their distance from a corner.
- **The Buffer Zone:** Add an extra 1-2 inches around the object in your mind. You don't want a frame to sit so close to a light switch that you bark your knuckles every time you turn on the lights.

## 2. Using "Placeholder Frames" in GalleryPlanner

GalleryPlanner has a clever way to handle these constraints. Instead of leaving "empty space" and hoping for the best, **mark the obstacles.**

1. **Add a Frame for the Obstacle:** Create a frame that matches the dimensions of your switch plate or sconce.
2. **Label It:** Click the frame and use the **Label** property. Type in "Light Switch" or "Sconce."
3. **Lock It:** Once positioned correctly according to your measurements, hit the **Lock** button. This ensures you don't accidentally move it while tinkering with your art.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** Set the "Frame Color" of these placeholder frames to something high-contrast (like a bright red) so you never forget they aren't part of the art collection.

## 3. Design Strategies: Embrace or Erase?

How you design around an obstacle depends on its visual "weight."

### The "Embrace" Method (Symmetry)
Use a decorative object like a wall sconce as the **center anchor** of your layout.
- Place the sconce as a "Locked Placeholder."
- Use **Smart Layout** to build a symmetrical arrangement around it.
- This makes the sconce feel like a curated part of the design.

### The "Erase" Method (Organic Flow)
For "ugly" necessities like thermostats or light switches, you want the eye to move *past* them.
- Use an **Asymmetrical** or **Salon** layout.
- Distribute frames around the obstacle with varied spacing.
- Because the layout is already organic, the "hole" created by the light switch will feel like just another part of the wall's texture.

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Constraints

### The Heating Vent
Vents are usually near the floor. Design your gallery wall with a high "Skyline" (aligning the tops of the frames) so the bottom row stays comfortably above the airflow and dust of the vent.

### The Intercom/Thermostat
These are often at eye level—prime real estate for art. Instead of leaving a giant gap, try "framing" the thermostat. Surround it with 3-4 small, high-interest frames (5x7s or 4x6s). This turns a plastic box into a focal point of a small cluster.

### The Corner Light Switch
If your gallery wall starts near a door, the light switch is your "Start Line." Align the edge of your first frame cluster with the horizontal line of the switch plate for a clean, architectural look.

## Summary: Designing in the Real World

A perfect gallery wall is one that looks like it belongs in your specific home. By measuring your constraints and using GalleryPlanner's **Lock and Label** features, you can turn a challenging wall into a professional-grade installation.
