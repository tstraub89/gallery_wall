# Conquering the Slope: Staircase Gallery Wall Design

Staircase walls are the ultimate gallery wall challenge—and the most rewarding when done right. This guide covers the geometry, safety rules, and GalleryPlanner features that make diagonal layouts achievable.

## Why Staircases Are Tricky

| Challenge | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Diagonal slope** | Frames must follow the stair angle for visual harmony |
| **Variable viewing height** | You see frames from above and below as you climb |
| **Safety clearance** | Frames too low = bumping heads and elbows |
| **Mixed sightlines** | Different frames visible from different positions |

---

## The Essential Measurements

Before opening GalleryPlanner, measure these three things:

| Measurement | What to Measure | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Wall width** | Horizontal distance along the staircase | Determines how many frames fit |
| **Wall height** | Vertical from stair nosing to ceiling (measure at multiple points) | Varies along the slope |
| **Stair angle** | Rise ÷ Run × 57.3 = degrees | Sets your layout diagonal |

### Calculating Your Stair Angle

Most stairs have a **30-40 degree** angle. Here's how to calculate yours:

1. **Measure the rise**: Height of one step (typically 7-8 inches)
2. **Measure the run**: Depth of one step (typically 10-11 inches)
3. **Calculate**: Rise ÷ Run = slope ratio

| Rise | Run | Ratio | Approximate Angle |
|------|-----|-------|-------------------|
| 7" | 11" | 0.64 | 32° |
| 7" | 10" | 0.70 | 35° |
| 8" | 10" | 0.80 | 39° |
| 8" | 9" | 0.89 | 42° |

## The Centerline Rule

The **centerline** of your gallery wall should run parallel to the handrail at a consistent height.

| Handrail Height | Recommended Centerline |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 34" (standard) | 48-52" above stair nosing |
| 36" (tall) | 50-54" above stair nosing |
| 42" (code max) | 52-56" above stair nosing |

**Pro tip:** The centerline isn't where frames sit—it's the imaginary line running through the *middle* of your entire gallery arrangement.

## Safety Clearance Requirements

Keep frames at a safe distance from the stairs to prevent bumps and damage.

| Zone | Minimum Clearance | Reason |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Above stair nosing | 4-6" | Avoid elbow bumps while using handrail |
| Head clearance | 6'8" minimum | Building code requirement |
| From handrail | 2-3" | Room for hands + visual breathing space |

## Using GalleryPlanner's Staircase Mode

GalleryPlanner has a dedicated **Staircase Mode** that handles the geometric complexity for you.

### How to Enable

1. Go to **Wall Configuration**
2. Select **"Staircase Wall"** instead of "Standard Wall"
3. Enter your wall dimensions
4. Input your **stair angle** (use the table above)
5. Click **Apply**

### What Staircase Mode Does

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Angled canvas** | Shows your actual wall shape |
| **Diagonal Smart Layouts** | Algorithms respect the slope |
| **Clearance zones** | Highlights areas to avoid |
| **Angle guides** | Alignment lines follow the stair slope |

## Recommended Layouts for Staircases

| Layout Style | Best For | Frame Count |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Diagonal Line** | Minimalist, few frames | 3-5 frames |
| **Staggered Cascade** | Mixed sizes, organic feel | 5-9 frames |
| **Salon Slope** | Maximalist, floor-to-ceiling | 10+ frames |
| **Stepped Grid** | Uniform frames, modern look | 6-12 frames |

### The Diagonal Line

Arrange frames in a single line parallel to the stair slope. Works best with matching or similar-sized frames.

### The Staggered Cascade

Frames "step down" following the stairs but with organic spacing—like a waterfall of frames.

### The Salon Slope

Dense coverage from handrail to ceiling, with the slope running through the center of the arrangement.

## Common Staircase Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Fix |
|------------|--------|
| Frames too high at top | Start layout from the middle, work both directions |
| Ignoring the slope | Every frame centerpoint should sit on the diagonal |
| Too close to handrail | Maintain 2-3" clearance minimum |
| Mixed angles | All frames should be level (0°), not tilted to match stairs |

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Measure** your wall width, height at multiple points, and stair angle
2. **Enable Staircase Mode** in GalleryPlanner
3. **Build your frame library** with your actual inventory
4. **Use Smart Layout** to generate diagonal arrangements
5. **Adjust manually** for safety clearances
6. **Export your PDF guide** with exact nail positions
7. **Hang from the middle** and work outward in both directions
