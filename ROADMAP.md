# 🗺️ GalleryPlanner Roadmap & Future Goals

## 🤖 features & AI
- [ ] **Local AI Gallery Wall**: "Fully Automated automated AI gallery wall".
    - **Concept**: A tool that places frames and picks photos automatically.
    - **Tech**: Light-weight neural net for face detection + image processing heuristics + artistic rules.
    - **Privacy**: 100% local execution. No photo uploads. "Privacy First."
- [ ] **Gallery Wall Template Packs**: Pre-designed layouts for users who don't have frames yet (e.g., "The Grid", "The Spiral", "Staircase Special").

## 💰 Monetization & Pro
- [ ] **Stripe Integration**:
    - *Decision needed*: Build a custom checkout page vs. integrating into the new website structure.
- [ ] **Server-Side Verification**: Implement robust PRO status verification tied to Stripe purchases (replacing the current client-side only check).

## 📢 Marketing & Content
- [ ] **Blog / Content Hub**:
    - **Goal**: Drive SEO/AIO traffic.
    - **Strategy**: AI-generated content is acceptable. Focus on "How to hang a gallery wall", "Interior design tips", etc.
- [ ] **Visual Demos**: Create GIFs or short web videos demonstrating app usage (Drag & Drop, Auto-Arrange, etc.) to immediately show value.
- [ ] **Social Promotion**: Reddit & Pinterest campaigns.

## ☁️ Infrastructure & Philosophy
- [ ] **Cloud Integration?**
    - *Discussion point*: Does this go against the "Local Only" philosophy?
    - Potential for "Optional Cloud" for cross-device syncing without forcing it.
