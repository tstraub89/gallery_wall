# Gallery Wall Planner 🖼️✨

**Visualize your perfect gallery wall before you hang a single nail.**

A powerful, interactive web application designed to help you plan complex gallery layouts with real frames and personal photos. Transition from a pile of frames on the floor to a perfectly aligned wall with confidence.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

*   **Precision Layout Canvas**: An infinite workspace with pan, zoom, and smart snapping tools (`S`, `#`) for pixel-perfect alignment.
*   **Inventory First Workflow**: Keep track of your physical frames. Even if you remove a frame from the wall, it stays in your "Unplaced" library for later use.
*   **Instant Visualization**: Drag and drop photos from your computer directly onto frames to see your memories in situ.
*   **Intelligent Import**: Quickly build your library by pasting a list of dimensions (e.g., "8x10", "11 1/4 x 14"). The app handles fractions and matting automatically.
*   **Print-Ready Photo Export**: preparing your gallery for reality? Export all your cropped, high-resolution photos in a single ZIP, ready for printing.
*   **Template Support**: Switch between standard flat walls and specialized staircase configurations (ascending/descending).
